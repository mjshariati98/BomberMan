# Bomberman

My first programming project EVER!

This game is playable in single and multiplayer modes with four different types of enemies and nine power-ups. You can save your game and continue it later whenever you like. Players in a multiplayer game can chat with each other in the implemented chatroom. You can also add your custom enemy type with java reflection! 

Some things I've learned through this project:
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Multithreading
- Socket Programming
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Databases (MySQL)
- Reflection
